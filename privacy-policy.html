              <p>
                I, <strong>Madeleine Hill</strong>, am the sole owner and developer of <strong>mh11wi.github.io</strong> (hereon referred to as the "Site"). It is intended to be an online portfolio — a place for me to share my work with <strong>you</strong>, the visitor. Thank you for your interest in my content!
              </p>
              <p>
                By using the Site, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following terms & privacy policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately. You also represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and have given your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use the Site.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">My Intellectual Property</h2>
              <p>
                There are two forms of content served on the Site, which are my intellectual property:
                <ul>
                  <li>my web applications, and</li>
                  <li>my personal blog posts.</li>
                </ul>
                This includes any source code, page designs, text, photographs, and graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                 The content is "AS IS" for your information and personal use only. Please note that any text was written by myself, and reflects my thoughts and opinions at the time of publishing. Also, all embedded images either
                <ul>
                  <li>are fair use to the best of my knowledge,</li>
                  <li>were created or taken by myself, or</li>
                  <li>were sourced and credited accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise indicated, no content may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without prior written permission.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">Your Data and Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                The Site is hosted on GitHub Pages and is subject to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service" target="_blank">GitHub Terms of Service</a>. As such, all of its pages are static, and all of my web applications are purely front-end. What this means is that I do not <em>personally</em> store any data in a central location, like a database. However, some data is stored on your device or is collected by third-party services, which I will disclose below:
              </p>
              <h3>Local Storage</h3>
              <p>
                When you alter the game settings in either <a href="https://mh11wi.github.io/WordDisks/" target="_blank">Word Disks</a> or <a href="https://mh11wi.github.io/SumDisks/" target="_blank">Sum Disks</a>, these settings are saved in your browser's local storage for your convenience. This data can easily be erased when clearing your browser history though.
              </p>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                A cookie is a small piece of data sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the website again and make the website more useful to you. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I use cookies on the Site for the following:
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>ANALYSIS</strong> – to analyze the traffic and performance of each page.</li>
                  <li><strong>ADVERTISING</strong> – to display relevant ads to you on some pages.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Google Analytics service is used for my analysis. I use the information gathered from their cookies to create reports about Site usage. In particular, I am interested in where visitors are coming from, which pages they visit, and for how long on average. You can choose to opt-out from Google Analytics though using their <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">browser add-on</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Google AdSense service is used for advertising. I've decided to include a couple of ads on the Site to try to earn some passive income on specific work. These ads have been placed as nicely as possible to not interfere with the content. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on the websites you've previously visited. You may opt-out of personalised ads by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google's ads settings</a>, or by visiting <a href="https://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> for other vendors.
              </p>
              <p>
                For more information about the data Google collects with both services, and what they do with it, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's privacy policy</a>.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">Other Disclaimers</h2>
              <p>
                The Site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that I am not responsible for the content or activities of such sites. If you are directed away from my Site, I encourage you to read their independent privacy statements.
              </p>
              <p>
                I reserve the right to modify these terms & privacy policy at any time without notice to you. Changes will take effect immediately upon their posting, so please take note of the date listed above and review this page frequently.
              </p>
              <p>
                A link to my email address is available below should you have any concerns or wish to contact me.
