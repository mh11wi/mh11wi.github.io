              <h1>Why mh11wi Anyways?</h1>
              <time>May 4, 2023</time>
              <p>
                You may have been wondering why my username is "mh11wi". And while I wish had a better answer for you, it's just something I chose a long time ago that <em>made sense at the time</em>. Kind of like legacy code that's still chugging along! Over the years, though, the name has really grown on me. It has become my 'brand' in a way — I use it for email, various profiles, and of course this website. I've even begun reading mh11wi as a whole word (mill-wee) rather than each character individually in my head. That said, it's probably best to share the meaning behind these characters, before that context is lost.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">A Little History</h2>
              <p>
                I originally created this account to contribute to the Caribou Contests private repository when I was working for my professor at Brock University (you can read more on how this came about in my <a href="/blog/how-did-i-get-here.html" target="_blank">first blog post</a>). Like the other students working for Caribou at the time, I used my Brock login — mh11wi — to sign into Caribou. And so for consistency, I decided to use the same username on GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>
                Did I create my own Brock login? No. It was automatically generated for me when I first became a student. The naming convention seems to be as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>mh</strong> — my first and last initials,</li>
                <li><strong>11</strong>  — the year the account was created (2011),</li>
                <li><strong>wi</strong> — two random letters to guarantee uniqueness in their system.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That's really all there is to it. No deeper meaning; but we are definitely going to ignore the fact that 2011 was over a decade ago now.
              <h2 class="top-space">So Why Not Change It?</h2>
              <p>
                After finishing school and my time with Caribou, I wanted to create a professional presence online. Namely, a portfolio to share my work and other experiences. And that is how I learned about GitHub Pages! I considered changing my username at this time, knowing mh11wi would become the subdomain of my website. But I honestly couldn't think of anything better — especially since what I wanted was a username I could use across different accounts, profiles, and email addresses that A) wouldn't already be taken, and B) still representative of myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Surprisingly, "Madeleine Hill" is more common of name than you'd think. No really, Google it! On many platforms, usernames like "mhill" and "hillm", or even "MadeleineHill" and "madeleine_hill" already exist. And I didn't want to just tack on a bunch of numbers to the end.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, it's probably for the best, because frankly, my name gets misspelled <strong>a lot</strong>. More often than not I'm called "Madeline" by mistake. And me, being a little socially awkward, usually just accepts it. Lately I've been trying to avoid the issue by joking that my name <em>is like the cake, not the cartoon</em>. Which works well in person, but an online platform is not going to correct you in the same way if you type the wrong name. 
              </p>

                  <img src="/images/madeleine-cake.jpg" alt="Madeleine Cake" class="img-responsive center-block" />

              </div>
              <p>
                It's funny, because all of this is just reminding me of the famous quote:
                <blockquote>
                  <p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>
                  <p class="quote-attribution">— Phil Karlton</p>
                </blockquote>
                While mh11wi may not traditionally seem like a good name, it's short, it's unique, and has served me well over the last few years.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">Lessons Learned</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>It's true, naming things <em>really is hard</em>.</li>
                <li>If somebody misspells or mispronounces your name, it's better to correct them.</li>
                <li>For better searchability, try to be as consistent as possible with naming.</li>
              </ul>
