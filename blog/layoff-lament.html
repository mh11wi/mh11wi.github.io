              <h1>Layoff Lament</h1>
              <time>February 21, 2023</time>
              <p>
                What would have been my 1<sup>st</sup> work anniversary at my last company is quickly approaching. I cannot believe how fast time has flown by since I was laid off at the end of September. While I am mostly at peace with their decision, and ready to move on, I have been finding myself in my feelings lately. This blog post will probably be a little short and all over the place, but I just wanted a place to vent.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">Layoffs Suck</h2>
              <p>
                I mean, the heading says it all. Whether you're a remaining employee trying to pick up the pieces, or unfortunately the one let go, the situation honestly just sucks. I've often felt "survivor's guilt" after losing teammates in the past â€” sad that they're gone, but ultimately relieved to still have a job. And now, being laid off myself, I feel more expendable than anything. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Since the end of 2022, it seems like every week (and in some weeks, every day!) there is a new mass layoff announcement. It can get pretty depressing scrolling through LinkedIn sometimes. And it seems like no company is safe from it; big or small, profitable or not. I've even read horror stories about employees having their credentials revoked before learning that their company is downsizing. Thankfully that was not my case. But man, the anxiety of an impromptu company-wide meeting is all too real!
              </p>
              <p>
                And even if you're told that the decision is economical and not personal, it's still a tough pill to swallow. I've never been a super confident person. I don't think that I truly believed the decision was <em>not</em> performance related until I saw some of my amazingly talented co-workers who were also affected. That said, I am so appreciative of the support I've received those first few days from friends, family, and former colleagues.
              </p>
              <h2 class="top-space">Taking a Pause</h2>
              <p>
                I decided to take a break after being laid off for the remaining of 2022. And yes, I realize how priveleged I am to be able to do so. I wanted to make the best of a bad situation, but frankly I was just <strong>tired</strong>. I have been working at some capacity since I was tweleve, while also being a top student academically. After highschool, I continued on in higher ed for about seven years, and started my full-time career almost immediately afterwards. Plus, I figured hiring plans would be slower during the holiday months.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that it's 2023, I've begun interviewing again for some new opportunities. Rejection is never fun, but I try to use it as a learning opportunity. I will say, though, that the competition is fierce! Part of me wonders if I waited too long to jump back in, but I honestly do not regret the time I had off. Yes I was recharging, but I also worked on a couple personal projects that I am excited to tell you all about another day.

              <h2 class="top-space">Lessons Learned</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>A company is going to do what it's going to do, with or without you.</li>
                <li>Mass layoffs are not usually performance related, don't beat yourself up.</li>
                <li>If you are able to, take the time to recharge and put your best interests first.</li>
